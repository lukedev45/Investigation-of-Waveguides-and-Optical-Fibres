# Investigation of Waveguides and Optical Fibres

This repository contains the full documentation and report for an undergraduate research project exploring the theory and numerical analysis of optical waveguides, with a focus on optical fibres.

Optical fibres guide light via total internal reflection and support discrete propagation modes. Understanding these modes and how they depend on refractive index profiles is fundamental to optical communication systems and photonics research.

## 📄 Project Overview

The core goals of this project were to:

- Derive the modal equations governing guided light propagation in dielectric waveguides from Maxwell’s equations.
- Formulate and solve the resulting eigenvalue problems to obtain mode profiles.
- Analyse how refractive index structures influence waveguide properties.
- Apply numerical methods to compute guided modes and visualise field distributions.

The work develops mathematical models for waveguide modes and demonstrates how physical parameters affect light confinement and dispersion.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

The project engages with several foundational topics in waveguide optics and physical modelling:

- **Wave propagation in guided structures:** Light confined in a high-index core surrounded by lower-index cladding.
- **Eigenvalue formulation:** Converting boundary-value problems into discrete mode solutions.
- **Mode analysis:** Identifying how core/cladding profiles influence supported modes.
- **Numerical computation:** Implementing algorithms to approximate eigenmodes relevant for optical fibre design.

These concepts are central in photonics and communication systems where optical fibres are utilised for high-speed data transmission.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
